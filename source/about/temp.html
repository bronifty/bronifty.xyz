  I am a software engineer currently working in the Data industry with an
  interest at the intersection of modern pipelines with wasm, serverless and
  kubernetes (think Fluvio and Kubeflow) as well as React on the frontend for
  apps, even a little Angular for the patterns and some other things. I'm not
  well known as a creator of anything in particular, mostly a generalist who
  enjoys talking to people about various things. I'd like to see what's possible
  with putting everything in WASM modules on the edge as serverless functions
  and for the rest either orchestrate it with containers or do something else
  like Hashicorp's system for managing servers of all different types in their
  app production paradigm. Terraform seems like a pretty standard tool for
  managing infrastructure declaratively, but I'm also interested in other
  formats such as Argo gitops and Score.dev, which are abstractions to
  facilitate IaC. Ultimately, I'd like to work on fun technology and deploy like
  an SRE. The best way to reach me is on
